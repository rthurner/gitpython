Versioning jupyter notebook with supporting files
1. Create a directory E:\PR\GitPython
   This is to show that any directory can be used anywhere
   create readme.md, description.txt (me), and the YahooQ.ipynb
   create subdirectory Data
   store Yahoq.csv, NQuotex.csv
2. Initialize git in this directory E:\PR\GitPython
   git init 
   confirms .git created here
   shows untracked files
3. add files
   git add description.txt  (empty)
   git add readme.md, 
   git add YahoQ.ipynb,
      produces the following message
      Reinhold@REINHOLDPC MINGW64 /e/pr/gitpython (master)
      $ git add YahooQ.ipynb
      warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in YahooQ.ipynb.
      The file will have its original line endings in your working directory.  
   cd Data
     add Yahoq.csv
4. git commit -m "this was the initial commit"
   4 files changed 785 insertions (+)
   create mode 100644 Data/Yahoq.csv
       note: correct reference of file in subdirectory
   create mode 100644 description.txt
   	note: when added description.txt was empty
   	
   
5. save description.txt
   change YahoQ.csv 
   git status:
   
   """"On branch master
	Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   Data/Yahoq.csv
        modified:   description.txt

	Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        .ipynb_checkpoints/
        Data/NQuotex.csv

	no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")""""
 
    git informs:
    - changes occured in current directory and in subdirectory
    - there are still unchecked files
    
6. git diff  description.txt
   shows the changes made to description.txt
   "+       note: correct reference of file in subdirectory
+   create mode 100644 description.txt
+       note: when added description.txt was empty"
+  to leave the display mode: enter :q

   git diff "Data/Yahoq.csv"
    Shows the diference 
7. some git diffs
     git diff --stat
     git diff HEAD  shows the full difference
8. git config --list

9. git commit  
    shows changed files  not staged for commit:
    $ git commit
    """"
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
        modified:   Data/Yahoq.csv
        modified:   description.txt

Untracked files:
        .ipynb_checkpoints/
        Data/NQuotex.csv

no changes added to commit
     """"
     Explanation: git reports changes but does not stage them
     you can individually stage the for commit or..
     you can commit -a (this means all changes are staged and commited
     without -m ...... create a message in vim
